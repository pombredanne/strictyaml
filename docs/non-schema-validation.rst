Non-schema validation
---------------------

When using strictyaml you do not have to specify a schema. If
you do this, the validator "Any" is used which will accept any
mapping and any list and any scalar values (which will always be
interpreted as a string, unlike regular YAML).

This is the recommended approach when rapidly prototyping and the
desired schema is fluid.

When your prototype code is parsing YAML that has a more fixed
structure, we recommend that you 'lock it down' with a schema.

The Any validator can be used inside fixed structures as well.

.. code-block:: python

    from strictyaml import Any, MapPattern, load

With variable 'valid_sequence':

.. code-block:: yaml

  a:
    x: 9
    y: 8
  b: 2
  c: 3



.. code-block:: python

    load(valid_sequence) == {"a": {"x": "9", "y": "8"}, "b": "2", "c": "3"}
    >>> True

This is equivalent to the above statement

.. code-block:: python

    load(valid_sequence, Any()) == {"a": {"x": "9", "y": "8"}, "b": "2", "c": "3"}
    >>> True

You can fix the schema of higher levels of the YAML and not lower levels

.. code-block:: python

    load(valid_sequence, MapPattern(Any(), Any())) == {"a": {"x": "9", "y": "8"}, "b": "2", "c": "3"}
    >>> True
