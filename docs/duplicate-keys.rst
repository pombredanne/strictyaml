Duplicate keys
--------------

Duplicate keys are allowed in regular YAML - as parsed by pyyaml, ruamel.yaml and poyo:

Not only is it unclear whether x should be "cow" or "bull" (the parser will decide 'bull', but did you know that?),
if there are 200 lines between x: cow and x: bull, a user might very likely change the *first* x and erroneously believe
that the resulting value of x has been changed - when it hasn't.

In order to avoid all possible confusion, StrictYAML will simply refuse to parse this and will only accept associative
arrays where all of the keys are unique. It will throw a DuplicateKeysDisallowed exception.

.. code-block:: python

    from strictyaml import load, DuplicateKeysDisallowed

With variable 'duplicate':

.. code-block:: yaml

  a: cow
  a: bull



.. code-block:: python

    load(duplicate)
    >>> EXCEPTION RAISED:
      While parsing
        in "<unicode string>", line 2, column 1:
          a: bull
          ^ (line: 2)
      Duplicate key 'a' found
        in "<unicode string>", line 2, column 2:
          a: bull
           ^ (line: 2)
